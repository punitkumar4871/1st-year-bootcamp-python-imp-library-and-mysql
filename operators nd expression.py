# operators:- in python are used to do certain operations in pythons

# An expression:- in Python is a combination of values, variables, operators, and function calls that are evaluated to produce a new value. Expressions are fundamental building blocks in Python programming, allowing you to perform calculations, manipulate data, and determine control flow.

# Expressions and Operators
a = 10
b = 3

# Arithmetic Operators
print(a + b)  # Addition: 13
print(a - b)  # Subtraction: 7
print(a * b)  # Multiplication: 30
print(a / b)  # Division: 3.3333333333333335
print(a // b) # Floor Division: 3
print(a % b)  # Modulus: 1
print(a ** b) # Exponentiation: 1000

# Comparison Operators
print(a == b) # Equal to: False
print(a != b) # Not equal to: True
print(a > b)  # Greater than: True
print(a < b)  # Less than: False
print(a >= b) # Greater than or equal to: True
print(a <= b) # Less than or equal to: False

# Logical Operators
print(a > 5 and b < 5)  # and: True
print(a > 5 or b < 1)   # or: True
print(not(a > 5 and b < 5)) # not: False

# code:-
a = 7
b = 2

# addition
print ('Sum: ', a + b)  

# subtraction
print ('Subtraction: ', a - b)   

# multiplication
print ('Multiplication: ', a * b)  

# division
print ('Division: ', a / b) 

# floor division
print ('Floor Division: ', a // b)

# modulo
print ('Modulo: ', a % b)  

# a to the power b
print ('Power: ', a ** b)
