# Python Tuples

## Introduction

A tuple is an immutable sequence type in Python. Tuples are similar to lists, but unlike lists, the elements of a tuple cannot be changed once the tuple is created. Tuples are defined by enclosing the elements in parentheses `()`.

## Creating Tuples

Tuples can be created in several ways:

### Example 1: Creating a Tuple

```python
# Creating a tuple with multiple elements
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)
print(my_tuple)  # Output: (1, 2, 3)

# Creating a tuple with a single element
single_element_tuple = (1,)
print(single_element_tuple)  # Output: (1,)

# Creating a tuple without parentheses
another_tuple = 4, 5, 6
print(another_tuple)  # Output: (4, 5, 6)

# Creating an empty tuple
empty_tuple = ()
print(empty_tuple)  # Output: ()
```

# Accessing Tuple Elements
Tuple elements can be accessed using indexing and slicing, similar to lists.

# Example 2: Indexing and Slicing
```python 
my_tuple = (10, 20, 30, 40, 50)
```

# Accessing elements using indexing
```python 
print(my_tuple[0])  # Output: 10
print(my_tuple[3])  # Output: 40
```

# Accessing elements using negative indexing
```python 
print(my_tuple[-1])  # Output: 50
print(my_tuple[-2])  # Output: 40
```

# Slicing a tuple
```python 
print(my_tuple[1:4])  # Output: (20, 30, 40)
print(my_tuple[:3])   # Output: (10, 20, 30)
print(my_tuple[2:])   # Output: (30, 40, 50)
print(my_tuple[:])    # Output: (10, 20, 30, 40, 50)
```


# Tuple Immutability
Once a tuple is created, its elements cannot be changed, added, or removed. Attempting to modify a tuple results in an error.

# Example 3: Tuple Immutability
```python

my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)


# Trying to change an element
# my_tuple[0] = 10  # This will raise a TypeError

# Trying to append an element
# my_tuple.append(4)  # This will raise an AttributeError

# Trying to remove an element
# del my_tuple[1]  # This will raise a TypeError
```

# Methods of Tuples in Python

## Introduction

Tuples in Python are immutable sequences, and they support a limited number of methods compared to lists. The two main methods available for tuples are `count` and `index`.

## Tuple Methods

### 1. `count`

The `count` method returns the number of times a specified element appears in the tuple.

#### Syntax

```python
tuple.count(value)
```
# Parameters
### value: The element to be counted in the tuple.
#### Example
```python
my_tuple = (1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 2)
```
# Counting occurrences of the element 2
```python
count_of_twos = my_tuple.count(2)
print(count_of_twos)  # Output: 3
```
# 2. index
The index method returns the index of the first occurrence of the specified element in the tuple. If the element is not found, it raises a ValueError.

### Syntax
```python
tuple.index(value, [start], [end])
```
## Parameters
value: The element whose index needs to be found.
[start] (optional): The starting index from where the search should begin.
[end] (optional): The ending index where the search should stop.
### Example
```python
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 4, 2)

# Finding the index of the element 3
index_of_three = my_tuple.index(3)
print(index_of_three)  # Output: 2

# Finding the index of the element 2 starting from index 2
index_of_two = my_tuple.index(2, 2)
print(index_of_two)  # Output: 4
```
# list vs tuple

Lists and Tuples in Python are two classes of Python Data Structures.
The list structure is dynamic, and readily changed whereas the tuple structure is static and cannot be changed. This means that the tuple is generally faster than the list.
Lists are denoted by square brackets and tuples are denoted with parenthesis

# List:
1.)Lists are mutable
2.)The implication of iterations is Time-consuming
3.)The list is better for performing operations, such as insertion and deletion.
4.)Lists consume more memory
5.)Lists have several built-in methods
6.)Unexpected changes and errors are more likely to occur
# Tuple:
1.) Tuples are immutable
2.)The implication of iterations is comparatively Faster
3.) A Tuple data type is appropriate for accessing the elements
4.) Tuple consumes less memory as compared to the list

#### Tuple does not have many built-in methods.
##### Because tuples don’t change they are far less error-prone.
Which is better list or tuple in Python? As tuples are stored in a single memory block therefore they don’t require extra space for new objects whereas the lists are allocated in two blocks, first the fixed one with all the Python object information and second a variable-sized block for the data.
In Python, both lists and tuples support a range of operations, including indexing, slicing, concatenation, and more. However, there are some differences between the operations that are available for lists and tuples due to their mutability and immutability, respectively
when to use tuple over list : In Python, tuples and lists are both used to store collections of data, but they have some important differences. Here are some situations where you might want to use tuples instead of lists





# COUNT

The count() method of Tuple returns the number of times the given element appears in the tuple.

# Syntax: tuple.count(element)

Where the element is the element that is to be counted.


# 1.  Creating tuples 
```python
Tuple1 = (0, 1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 1, 3, 2) 
Tuple2 = ('python', 'geek', 'python','for', 'java', 'python') 

# count the appearance of 3 
res = Tuple1.count(3) 
print('Count of 3 in Tuple1 is:', res) 

# count the appearance of python 
res = Tuple2.count('python') 
print('Count of Python in Tuple2 is:', res)
    2.
# Creating tuples 
Tuple = (0, 1, (2, 3), (2, 3), 1, [3, 2], 'geeks', (0,)) 

# count the appearance of (2, 3) 
res = Tuple.count((2, 3)) 
print('Count of (2, 3) in Tuple is:', res) 

# count the appearance of [3, 2] 
res = Tuple.count([3, 2]) 
print('Count of [3, 2] in Tuple is:', res)
     

#### 3.
fruits_tuple = ("apple", "banana", "orange", "apple", "grape")
apple_count = fruits_tuple.count("apple")
print("Number of apples:", apple_count)  
     

#### 4.
numbers_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 4)
count_1 = numbers_tuple.count(1)
count_2 = numbers_tuple.count(2)
print("Count of 1:", count_1)  
print("Count of 2:", count_2)  
```


# INDEX:-
The Index() method returns the first occurrence of the given element from the tuple.

## Syntax: tuple.index(element, start, end)

## Parameters:

### element: 
The element to be searched. start (Optional): The starting index from where the searching is started end (Optional): The ending index till where the searching is done

#### Note: This method raises a ValueError if the element is not found in the tuple.

```python
# Creating tuples 
Tuple = (0, 1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 1, 3, 2) 

# getting the index of 3 
res = Tuple.index(3) 
print('First occurrence of 3 is', res) 

# getting the index of 3 after 4th 
# index 
res = Tuple.index(3, 4) 
print('First occurrence of 3 after 4th index is:', res)
```
     
# Built-in Functions

## len(list/tuple): Returns the length (number of elements) of the list or tuple.
```python 
numbers_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
length = len(numbers_list)
print("Length of the list:", length)  # Output: Length of the list: 5

numbers_tuple = (10, 20, 30)
length = len(numbers_tuple)
print("Length of the tuple:", length)  # Output: Length of the tuple: 3
```


# sum(tuple): Calculates the sum of all elements in the list or tuple.
``` python
numbers_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
total_sum = sum(numbers_list)
print("Sum of numbers:", total_sum)  # Output: Sum of numbers: 15

numbers_tuple = (10, 20, 30)
total_sum = sum(numbers_tuple)
print("Sum of numbers_tuple:", total_sum)  # Output: Sum of numbers_tuple: 60
```
     
# max(tuple): Returns the element with the highest value in the list or tuple.
```python
numbers_list = [1, 5, 2, 8, 3]
largest = max(numbers_list)
print("Largest number:", largest)  # Output: Largest number: 8

numbers_tuple = (10, 20, 30)
largest = max(numbers_tuple)
print("Largest number in tuple:", largest)  # Output: Largest number in tuple: 30
```


# min(tuple): Returns the element with the lowest value in the list or tuple.
```python
numbers_list = [1, 5, 2, 8, 3]
smallest = min(numbers_list)
print("Smallest number:", smallest)  # Output: Smallest number: 1

numbers_tuple = (10, 20, 30)
smallest = min(numbers_tuple)
print("Smallest number in tuple:", smallest)  # Output: Smallest number in tuple: 10
```
     
# sorted(tuple): Returns a new list/tuple with elements arranged in ascending order by default.
```python
numbers_list = [1, 5, 2, 8, 3]
sorted_list = sorted(numbers_list)
print("Sorted list:", sorted_list)  # Output: Sorted list: [1, 2, 3, 5, 8]

numbers_tuple = (10, 20, 30, 4, 5)
sorted_tuple = sorted(numbers_tuple)
print("Sorted tuple:", sorted_tuple)  # Output: Sorted tuple: [4, 5, 10, 20, 30]
```
