# list
### A list in Python is a built-in data structure that represents an ordered collection of items and  it is a dynamically sized array data structure which allow our data to be stored in [] these brackets:
# properties of list data structure:-
### 1.)Ordered:

Lists maintain the order of elements as they are added. This means that the order in which elements are inserted is preserved.
### 2.)Mutable:

Lists can be modified after their creation. Elements can be changed, added, or removed.
### 3.)Dynamic:

Lists can grow and shrink in size as needed. Elements can be appended, inserted, or removed dynamically.
### 4.)Heterogeneous:

Lists can contain elements of different types. A single list can store integers, strings, floats, other lists, and more.
### 5.)Indexed:

Each element in a list has an index, which starts at 0 for the first element. Negative indexing is also supported, with -1 referring to the last element.
### 6.)Slicing:

Lists support slicing operations, allowing the creation of sublists by specifying a range of indices.
### 7.)Iterable:

Lists can be iterated over using loops (such as for loops) making it easy to process each element sequentially.
### 8.)Flexible Size:

Lists do not have a fixed size. They can accommodate a varying number of elements, which can be adjusted as needed.
### 9.)Contiguous Memory Allocation:

lists use contiguous memory allocation, which can make element access fast. However, this may lead to inefficiencies when frequently resizing.
### 10.)Variable Length:

Lists can have varying lengths, and there is no need to declare the size of a list when it is created.



# for example:-
### Ordered:

```python

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(fruits)  # Output: ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
```
### Mutable:

```python

numbers = [1, 2, 3]
numbers[1] = 10
print(numbers)  # Output: [1, 10, 3]
```
### Dynamic:
```python

dynamic_list = [1, 2, 3]
dynamic_list.append(4)
dynamic_list.remove(2)
print(dynamic_list)  # Output: [1, 3, 4]
```
### Heterogeneous:

```python
mixed_list = [1, "hello", 3.14, True]
print(mixed_list)  # Output: [1, 'hello', 3.14, True]
```
### Indexed:

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(fruits[0])  # Output: apple
print(fruits[-1])  # Output: cherry
```
### Slicing:
```python

numbers = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
sliced = numbers[2:5]
print(sliced)  # Output: [2, 3, 4]
```
### Iterable:

```python

for fruit in ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]:
    print(fruit)
# Output:
# apple
# banana
# cherry
```
### Flexible Size:

```python
flexible_list = []
flexible_list.append(1)
flexible_list.extend([2, 3, 4])
print(flexible_list)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]
```



# list functions or methods
#### As we have studied oops so we know classes so list is also class as we know we can make our own datastructure by oops for specific purposes so list is also a class which have methods define in it such as len , sort, index,etc.


## 1.)append(x): Adds an item x to the end of the list.

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana"]
fruits.append("cherry")
print(fruits)  # Output: ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
```
## 2.)extend: Extends the list by appending all the items from the iterable.

```python

fruits = ["apple", "banana"]
fruits.extend(["cherry", "date"])
print(fruits)  # Output: ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'date']
```
## 3.)insert(i, x): Inserts an item x at a given position i.

```python

fruits = ["apple", "banana"]
fruits.insert(1, "cherry")
print(fruits)  # Output: ['apple', 'cherry', 'banana']
```
## 4.)remove(x): Removes the first item from the list whose value is x.

```python

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
fruits.remove("banana")
print(fruits)  # Output: ['apple', 'cherry']
```
## 5.)pop[i]: Removes the item at the given position i in the list and returns it. If no index is specified, pop() removes and returns the last item in the list.

```python

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
popped_item = fruits.pop(1)
print(fruits)  # Output: ['apple', 'cherry']
print(popped_item)  # Output: banana
```
## 6.)clear(): Removes all items from the list.

```python

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
fruits.clear()
print(fruits)  # Output: []
```
## 7.)index(x, [start[, end]]): Returns the index of the first item whose value is x. The optional arguments start and end are used to limit the search to a particular subsequence of the list.

```python

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
index = fruits.index("cherry")
print(index)  # Output: 2
```
## 8.)count(x): Returns the number of times x appears in the list.

```python

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "apple"]
count = fruits.count("apple")
print(count)  # Output: 2
```
## 9.)sort(key=None, reverse=False): Sorts the items of the list in place (the arguments can be used for sort customization).

```python

numbers = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6]
numbers.sort()
print(numbers)  # Output: [1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9]


numbers.sort(reverse=True)
print(numbers)  # Output: [9, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 1]
```
## 10.)reverse(): Reverses the elements of the list in place.

```python
Copy code
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
fruits.reverse()
print(fruits)  # Output: ['cherry', 'banana', 'apple']
```
## 11.)copy(): Returns a shallow copy of the list.

```python
Copy code
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
fruits_copy = fruits.copy()
print(fruits_copy)  # Output: ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
```
