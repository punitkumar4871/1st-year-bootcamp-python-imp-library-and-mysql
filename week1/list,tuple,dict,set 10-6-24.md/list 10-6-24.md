# list
### A list in Python is a built-in data structure that represents an ordered collection of items and  it is a dynamically sized array data structure which allow our data to be stored in [] these brackets:
# properties of list data structure:-
### 1.)Ordered:

Lists maintain the order of elements as they are added. This means that the order in which elements are inserted is preserved.
### 2.)Mutable:

Lists can be modified after their creation. Elements can be changed, added, or removed.
### 3.)Dynamic:

Lists can grow and shrink in size as needed. Elements can be appended, inserted, or removed dynamically.
### 4.)Heterogeneous:

Lists can contain elements of different types. A single list can store integers, strings, floats, other lists, and more.
### 5.)Indexed:

Each element in a list has an index, which starts at 0 for the first element. Negative indexing is also supported, with -1 referring to the last element.
### 6.)Slicing:

Lists support slicing operations, allowing the creation of sublists by specifying a range of indices.
### 7.)Iterable:

Lists can be iterated over using loops (such as for loops) making it easy to process each element sequentially.
### 8.)Flexible Size:

Lists do not have a fixed size. They can accommodate a varying number of elements, which can be adjusted as needed.
### 9.)Contiguous Memory Allocation:

lists use contiguous memory allocation, which can make element access fast. However, this may lead to inefficiencies when frequently resizing.
### 10.)Variable Length:

Lists can have varying lengths, and there is no need to declare the size of a list when it is created.



# for example:-
### Ordered:

```python

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(fruits)  # Output: ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
```
### Mutable:

```python

numbers = [1, 2, 3]
numbers[1] = 10
print(numbers)  # Output: [1, 10, 3]
```
### Dynamic:
```python

dynamic_list = [1, 2, 3]
dynamic_list.append(4)
dynamic_list.remove(2)
print(dynamic_list)  # Output: [1, 3, 4]
```
### Heterogeneous:

```python
mixed_list = [1, "hello", 3.14, True]
print(mixed_list)  # Output: [1, 'hello', 3.14, True]
```
### Indexed:

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(fruits[0])  # Output: apple
print(fruits[-1])  # Output: cherry
```
### Slicing:
```python

numbers = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
sliced = numbers[2:5]
print(sliced)  # Output: [2, 3, 4]
```
### Iterable:

```python

for fruit in ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]:
    print(fruit)
# Output:
# apple
# banana
# cherry
```
### Flexible Size:

```python
flexible_list = []
flexible_list.append(1)
flexible_list.extend([2, 3, 4])
print(flexible_list)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]
```



# list functions or methods
#### As we have studied oops so we know classes so list is also class as we know we can make our own datastructure by oops for specific purposes so list is also a class which have methods define in it such as len , sort, index,etc.


## 1.)append(x): Adds an item x to the end of the list.

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana"]
fruits.append("cherry")
print(fruits)  # Output: ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
```
## 2.)extend: Extends the list by appending all the items from the iterable.

```python

fruits = ["apple", "banana"]
fruits.extend(["cherry", "date"])
print(fruits)  # Output: ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'date']
```
## 3.)insert(i, x): Inserts an item x at a given position i.

```python

fruits = ["apple", "banana"]
fruits.insert(1, "cherry")
print(fruits)  # Output: ['apple', 'cherry', 'banana']
```
## 4.)remove(x): Removes the first item from the list whose value is x.

```python

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
fruits.remove("banana")
print(fruits)  # Output: ['apple', 'cherry']
```
## 5.)pop[i]: Removes the item at the given position i in the list and returns it. If no index is specified, pop() removes and returns the last item in the list.

```python

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
popped_item = fruits.pop(1)
print(fruits)  # Output: ['apple', 'cherry']
print(popped_item)  # Output: banana
```
## 6.)clear(): Removes all items from the list.

```python

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
fruits.clear()
print(fruits)  # Output: []
```
## 7.)index(x, [start[, end]]): Returns the index of the first item whose value is x. The optional arguments start and end are used to limit the search to a particular subsequence of the list.

```python

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
index = fruits.index("cherry")
print(index)  # Output: 2
```
## 8.)count(x): Returns the number of times x appears in the list.

```python

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "apple"]
count = fruits.count("apple")
print(count)  # Output: 2
```
## 9.)sort(key=None, reverse=False): Sorts the items of the list in place (the arguments can be used for sort customization).

```python

numbers = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6]
numbers.sort()
print(numbers)  # Output: [1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9]


numbers.sort(reverse=True)
print(numbers)  # Output: [9, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 1]
```
## 10.)reverse(): Reverses the elements of the list in place.

```python
Copy code
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
fruits.reverse()
print(fruits)  # Output: ['cherry', 'banana', 'apple']
```
## 11.)copy(): Returns a shallow copy of the list.

```python
Copy code
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
fruits_copy = fruits.copy()
print(fruits_copy)  # Output: ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
```

# list comprehention
list comprehension is used to reduce the code size i.e this can make programming less complex and can save time.
syntax:- l= [expression for item in iterable if condition]

# for ex.:-List comprehension to get the squares of even numbers
```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

squares_of_even_numbers = [x**2 for x in numbers if x % 2 == 0]
print(squares_of_even_numbers)  # Output: [4, 16, 36]
```

# example 2:- mul. 2 with whole list
```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
doubled_numbers = [x * 2 for x in numbers]
print(doubled_numbers)  # Output: [2, 4, 6, 8]
```



# indexing :- 
with the help of indexing we can acess element in constant time complexity and from a range we want.

## Introduction
List indexing in Python allows you to access individual elements within a list. Each element in a list has a specific position or index. Python uses zero-based indexing, meaning the first element of a list is accessed with index 0, the second element with index 1, and so on.

## Basic Indexing

### 1.)Accessing Elements

To access an element in a list, you use square brackets `[]` with the index of the element.

```python
cities = ["New York", "Los Angeles", "Chicago"]
print(cities[0])  # Output: New York
print(cities[1])  # Output: Los Angeles
print(cities[2])  # Output: Chicago
```

### 3.)negative indexing
Negative indexing allows you to access elements from the end of the list. The last element is accessed with index - the second last with -2  and so on.

```python
Copy code
cities = ["New York", "Los Angeles", "Chicago"]
print(cities[-1])  # Output: Chicago
print(cities[-2])  # Output: Los Angeles
print(cities[-3])  # Output: New York
```


### Slicing using indexing
List slicing allows you to access a subset of elements from a list. Slicing is done using the colon : operator.
#### Basic Slicing
```python
Copy code
numbers = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(numbers[1:4])  # Output: [1, 2, 3]
```
### Slicing with Step
You can also specify a step, which determines the increment between each index for the slice.

```python
Copy code
print(numbers[0:6:2])  # Output: [0, 2, 4]
```


### Modifying Lists using slicing
You can assign values to specific elements in a list using indexing.

```python
Copy code
colors = ["red", "blue", "green"]
colors[1] = "yellow"
print(colors)  # Output: ['red', 'yellow', 'green']
```


### Deleting Elements
You can delete elements from a list using the del statement.

```python
Copy code
colors = ["red", "blue", "green"]
del colors[1]
print(colors)  # Output: ['red', 'green']
```


# Slicing
Slicing in Python lists allows you to extract a subset of elements by specifying a range of indices

# Python List Slicing

## Introduction
List slicing in Python allows you to access a subset of elements from a list. Slicing is a powerful feature that makes it easy to extract portions of a list by specifying a start, stop, and step value.

## Basic Slicing

The basic syntax for list slicing is:

```python
list[start:stop:step]
```
start: The index at which the slice starts (inclusive).
stop: The index at which the slice ends (exclusive).
step: The amount by which the index increases.

# Example 1: Basic Slicing
```python
Copy code
numbers = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
sliced_numbers = numbers[1:4]
print(sliced_numbers)  # Output: [1, 2, 3]
```
In this example, the slice starts at index 1 and ends at index 4, but does not include index 4.

# Omitting Indices
You can omit the start or stop index to slice from the beginning or to the end of the list.

### Example 2: Slicing From the Beginning
```python
Copy code
numbers = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
sliced_numbers = numbers[:3]
print(sliced_numbers)  # Output: [0, 1, 2]
```
# Example 3: Slicing to the End
```python
Copy code
numbers = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
sliced_numbers = numbers[3:]
print(sliced_numbers)  # Output: [3, 4, 5]
```
# Slicing with Step
The step value determines the increment between each index for the slice. The default step value is 1.

### Example 4: Slicing with a Step
```python
Copy code
numbers = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
sliced_numbers = numbers[0:6:2]
print(sliced_numbers)  # Output: [0, 2, 4]
```
In this example, the slice starts at index 0 and ends at index 6, with a step of 2, so it includes every second element.

# Negative Indices and Steps
Negative indices count from the end of the list, and negative steps can be used to reverse the order.

### Example 5: Negative Indices
```python
Copy code
numbers = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
sliced_numbers = numbers[-3:-1]
print(sliced_numbers)  # Output: [3, 4]
```
# Example 6: Reversing a List
```python
Copy code
numbers = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
reversed_numbers = numbers[::-1]
print(reversed_numbers)  # Output: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0]
```


# searching in list 
## Python List Searching

## Introduction

Searching in a list involves finding the position of a specific element within the list. Python provides several ways to search for elements, with linear search and binary search being two of the most common methods.

## Linear Search

Linear search is the simplest search algorithm. It works by iterating through each element of the list until it finds the target element.

### How Linear Search Works

1. Start from the first element of the list.
2. Compare the target element with the current element.
3. If the target element matches the current element, return the index.
4. If the target element does not match and there are more elements in the list, move to the next element and repeat step 2.
5. If the end of the list is reached and the target element is not found, return a failure indication (e.g., -1 or None).

### Example of Linear Search

```python
def linear_search(lst, target):
    for index, element in enumerate(lst):
        if element == target:
            return index
    return -1

# Example usage
numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
target = 30
result = linear_search(numbers, target)
print(result)  # Output: 2
```
## Binary Search
Binary search is a more efficient algorithm but requires the list to be sorted. It works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.

### How Binary Search Works
1.)Start with two pointers, one at the beginning (low) and one at the end (high) of the list.
Calculate the middle index.
2.)Compare the target element with the middle element.
3.)If the target element matches the middle element, return the middle index.
4.)If the target element is smaller than the middle element, narrow the search interval to the lower half by updating the high pointer to middle - 1.
5.)If the target element is larger than the middle element, narrow the search interval to the upper half by updating the low pointer to middle + 1.
6.)Repeat steps 2-6 until the target element is found or the interval is empty.
### Example of Binary Search
```python
Copy code
def binary_search(lst, target):
    low = 0
    high = len(lst) - 1

    while low <= high:
        middle = (low + high) // 2
        middle_element = lst[middle]

        if middle_element == target:
            return middle
        elif middle_element < target:
            low = middle + 1
        else:
            high = middle - 1

    return -1

# Example usage
numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
target = 30
result = binary_search(numbers, target)
print(result)  # Output: 2
```


# sorting in list 
### list provide a method called sort () which sort list in n logn time complexicity. it is formed by combination of heap sort and sequential sort.

# Sorting a List in Python

## Introduction

Sorting is a common operation performed on lists in Python. The `sort` method allows you to sort the elements of a list in place, either in ascending or descending order.

## Using the `sort` Method

The `sort` method sorts the list in ascending order by default. You can also sort the list in descending order by using the `reverse` parameter.

### Example 1: Sorting a List in Ascending Order

```python
numbers = [5, 2, 9, 1, 5, 6]
numbers.sort()
print(numbers)  # Output: [1, 2, 5, 5, 6, 9]
```

### for decending order
```python 
numbers = [5, 2, 9, 1, 5, 6]
numbers.sort(reverse=True)
print(numbers)  # Output: [9, 6, 5, 5, 2, 1]
```



# Special Methods
Using special methods like reduce, map, filter, zip for advanced list operations.

### Sum of a list of numbers using reduce
```python
from functools import reduce
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
sum_result = reduce(lambda x, y: x + y, numbers)  
print("Sum using reduce:", sum_result)
```

## Finding the maximum value in a list using reduce
```python
max_result = reduce(lambda x, y: x if x > y else y, numbers)  
print("Max value using reduce:", max_result)
```

## Convert a list of numbers to their squares using map
```python
squares = list(map(lambda x: x ** 2, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5])) 
print("Squares using map:", squares)
```

## Convert a list of strings to their uppercase forms
```python
words = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
uppercased = list(map(str.upper, words)) 
print("Uppercased words using map:", uppercased)
```

## Filter a list to get only even numbers
```python
even_numbers = list(filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])) 
print("Even numbers using filter:", even_numbers)
```

## Filter a list to get words with more than 5 letters
```python

long_words = list(filter(lambda word: len(word) > 5, ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "date", "elderberry"])) 
print("Long words using filter:", long_words)
```

## Zip two lists to create pairs of elements
```python

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
quantities = [10, 20, 30]
fruit_quantities = list(zip(fruits, quantities))  
print("Zipped lists:", fruit_quantities)
```

## Zip three lists
```python

colors = ["red", "yellow", "red"]
fruit_colors_quantities = list(zip(fruits, colors, quantities)) 
print("Zipped three lists:", fruit_colors_quantities)
```
